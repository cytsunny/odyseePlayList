A chrome extension to add play list function until official support

Currently waiting for approval to be listed in Chrome 

I hope there will be a official play list function in odysee.com soon, but in case if it is still not yet supported:

## Features to add in mind
- export and import play list function

## Help needed
- I am no designer so would be great if someone can make a logo
- I am no designer so the extension does not look good. If someone can provide a design, I may see if I can change the extension to looks like the design
- I have no experience in adding test to chrome extension. If the play list is still not out for a few years, for easy maintainance, would need some guidience in adding test
